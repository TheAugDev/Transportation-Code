# Bug Fixes Applied - July 11, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ❌ **PWA Installation Error**
**Error**: `Uncaught ReferenceError: deferredPrompt is not defined`
**Cause**: The `deferredPrompt` variable was scoped locally and not accessible to the `installPWA` function.

**Fix Applied**:
- Moved `deferredPrompt` to global scope
- Added proper error handling in `installPWA` function
- Added fallback instructions for manual installation
- Clear `deferredPrompt` after successful installation

### 2. ⚠️ **Chart Canvas Detection Issues**
**Error**: `Progress chart canvas not found or not visible` / `Category chart canvas not found or not visible`
**Cause**: Charts were being created before the Statistics tab was activated, when canvas elements weren't visible.

**Fix Applied**:
- Modified chart creation to check if Statistics tab is active
- Added proper canvas visibility detection using `getBoundingClientRect()`
- Deferred chart creation until Statistics tab is actually accessed
- Improved error logging with specific dimension information

### 3. 🔧 **Application Initialization Optimization**
**Issue**: Charts were being created immediately on app load, causing unnecessary errors.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed immediate chart setup from `init()` method
- Charts now only created when Statistics tab is clicked
- Added better logging to track when charts are created
- Improved tab switching logic with specific chart handling

### 4. 📱 **Enhanced PWA Installation Experience**
**Improvement**: Better user experience for PWA installation.

**Enhancements Applied**:
- Added platform-specific installation instructions
- Improved error handling for unsupported browsers
- Added visual feedback for installation process
- Better logging for debugging installation issues

## Code Changes Summary

### app.js Changes:
1. **Global scope declaration**: `let deferredPrompt = null;`
2. **Enhanced chart detection**: Proper tab and visibility checking
3. **Improved installation flow**: Better error handling and fallback instructions
4. **Optimized initialization**: Charts created only when needed

### Performance Improvements:
- Faster initial load (no unnecessary chart creation)
- Better memory usage (charts only when visible)
- Improved mobile experience (proper error handling)
- Enhanced PWA functionality (better installation flow)
