# TCOLE Study Tool - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 **How to Add Your Study Content**

### **Super Simple Process:**

1. **Open a content file** from the `content-templates/` folder:
   - `penal-code-content.txt` - For Penal Code topics
   - `criminal-procedure-content.txt` - For Criminal Procedure topics  
   - `general-topics-content.txt` - For other TCOLE topics

2. **Copy your study handout** (PDF, Word doc, printed material, etc.)

3. **Paste it** into the content file where it says:
   ```
   PASTE YOUR STUDY HANDOUT CONTENT BELOW:
   =======================================
   ```

4. **Save the file**

5. **Open the study tool** in your browser and click "Load New Content"

6. **Select the course** you added content for

**That's it!** The system automatically creates flashcards and quiz questions from your content.

## 📝 **What the System Does Automatically:**

- **Extracts definitions** and creates flashcards
- **Identifies offense elements** and creates study cards
- **Finds punishment ranges** and creates reference cards
- **Generates practice questions** based on the content
- **Organizes everything** by topic and difficulty
- **Creates realistic scenarios** for practical application

## 📚 **Content Examples:**

### **What to Paste** (any format works):
```
PENAL CODE CHAPTER 22 - ASSAULT

22.01 ASSAULT
(a) A person commits an offense if the person:
    (1) intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury...
```

### **What You Get:**

- ✅ Study card: "What is the punishment for Class C Assault?"

## 🎯 **Supported Content Types:**

- **Statutes and codes** (PC, CCP, TRC, etc.)
- **Case summaries**
- **Procedure manuals**
- **Training handouts**
- **Study guides**
- **Any text-based legal content**

## 💡 **Tips for Best Results:**

1. **Include complete sections** - Don't break up statutes
2. **Keep formatting** - The system handles it automatically
3. **Add multiple topics** - More content = better study experience
4. **Test frequently** - Load content and review the generated questions

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting:**

**No flashcards created?**
- Make sure you pasted content after the divider line
- Check that the content has enough substance (more than a few sentences)

**Questions don't make sense?**
- The system learns from patterns - more complete content gives better results
- Try adding more context around definitions and procedures

**Want different categories?**
- The system auto-detects topics, but you can edit the generated content later
