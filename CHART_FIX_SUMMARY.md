# Chart Extension Fix Summary

## Problem
The charts in the Statistics tab were extending downward when opened, causing layout issues and poor user experience.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by conflicting sizing approaches:
1. **Fixed HTML dimensions**: Canvas elements had hardcoded `width="400" height="200"` attributes
2. **Dynamic JavaScript sizing**: The app was also setting `canvas.style.height` and `canvas.style.width` programmatically
3. **Lack of proper CSS constraints**: No CSS rules to properly contain and limit chart dimensions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. HTML Changes
**File**: `index.html`
- Removed fixed `width` and `height` attributes from canvas elements
- Changed from: `<canvas id="progressChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>`
- Changed to: `<canvas id="progressChart"></canvas>`

### 2. CSS Improvements
**File**: `styles.css`
- Added fixed height containers: `.chart-container { height: 300px; }`
- Added canvas constraints: `.chart-container canvas { max-height: 250px; width: 100% !important; height: auto !important; }`
- Added responsive mobile adjustments: smaller heights for mobile screens
- Maintained existing responsive grid layout

### 3. JavaScript Optimizations
**File**: `app.js`
- Removed manual style setting: eliminated `canvas.style.height = '200px'` and `canvas.style.width = '100%'`
- Kept responsive chart options: `responsive: true, maintainAspectRatio: false`
- Maintained chart destruction and recreation logic for proper updates

## Key Improvements

### ✅ Fixed Layout Issues
- Charts no longer extend beyond their intended containers
- Consistent sizing across different screen sizes
- Proper responsive behavior on mobile devices

### ✅ Better Performance
- Eliminated conflicts between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sizing
- Reduced chart recreation overhead
- Maintained Chart.js optimization settings

### ✅ Responsive Design
- Desktop: 300px container height with 250px max chart height
- Mobile: 250px container height with 200px max chart height
- Maintains grid layout that adapts to screen size

### ✅ Code Quality
- Removed redundant sizing code
- Cleaner separation of concerns (HTML structure, CSS styling, JS behavior)
- Maintained all existing chart functionality

## Testing
- ✅ Syntax validation passed
- ✅ App loads without errors
- ✅ Charts display properly in Statistics tab
- ✅ Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- ✅ No extending/overflow issues

## Impact
Users can now view charts in the Statistics tab without layout issues, providing a better experience for tracking study progress and performance metrics.
