CDM = Critical Decision-Making Model
 Objectives of Patrol
 • Preserve the peace by mere presence and proper action (CCP2.13)
 • Duty to prevent crime by opportunity reduction (CCP 6.06-6.07)
 • To suppress crime by timely response to crimes in progress 
• Properly investigate offenses (CCP 6.05-6.06) & apprehend suspects
 • Regulate non-criminal conduct by obtaining and maintaining good 
officer-citizen relationships to protect life and property (CCP 6.07)
 Importance of Patrol
 • Protection: Prevention of crime is the soundest of all criminological 
theories
 • Service: To the community of which peace officer is part

Discussed in week one
 Basic Peace Officer Course │ Chapter 35 │ Patrol Skills 
Introduction 
Unit Goal: Patrol function and preparation. 
Introduce Instructors 
Teach the various functions of patrol and how best to prepare 
Introduce the CDM model and how it applies to Police call response 
35.1 List the patrol functions 
Objectives of Patrol: 
To preserve the peace by mere presence and by proper action. (CCP 2.13) 
To prevent crime by opportunity reduction; duty to prevent. (CCP 6.06, 
6.07) 
To suppress crime by timely response to crimes in 
progress and by properly investigating offenses. (CCP 
6.05, 6.06) 
To apprehend suspects. 
To regulate non-criminal conduct by obtaining and maintaining 
good officer – citizen relationships to protect life and property. 
(CCP 6.07) 
35.1 continued 
Importance of Patrol: 
Protection: Prevention of crime is the soundest of all criminological 
theories. 
Service: To the community of which each peace officer is a part. 
35.2 Identify the methods of mental and physical preparation 
Mental Preparation 
The single most important factor in officer survival is mental conditioning. 
The transition from civilian work to employment as a police 
officer necessitates some mental and emotional conditioning to 
adapt to the psychological pressures of police work. 
Some factors involved in psychological preparedness: 
Attitude development and preparation 
Sociological and psychological maturity 
Both formal and informal education 
Personal value system 
Officers must avoid developing attitudes that are 
counterproductive of job performance: 
Isolationism and ostracizing others 
Becoming paranoid and regarding all people suspiciously 
or as would-be criminals 
Withdrawing from or failing to be a normal part of the community 
. 
Lecture Scenario: Refer students to Chapter Resources for excerpt from 
Grossman. 
Have students read and discuss. 
Physical Preparation: 
Before each shift, the officer should make a personal check for the 
following: 
Cleanliness 
Personal grooming 
Uniform: 
Tailored to fit as well as possible 
Clean, pressed and in good repair 
Shined footwear 
Well maintained duty belt 
Name tag 
Personal Equipment 
Notebook and pen or pencil 
Side arm(s)- clean, operational, and fully loaded 
Ammunition- both in the weapon and extra magazines should be 
clean, dry, and current 
Foul weather gear- boots, raincoat, cap cover, gloves 
Handcuffs- clean and operational; key(s) must be readily available for use 
Body armor- should be worn by each officer at all times while on duty 
Flashlight(s) 
Traffic whistle 
Personal Actions: 
Maintain good posture 
Keep hands out of pockets. 
Avoid stuffed pockets; minimize carried items. 
Do not smoke while confronting the public. 
Wear headgear properly, not cocked to one side or on the back of the 
head. 
Remember that a direct relationship exists between appearance and 
attitude. 
Esprit de corps is higher among officers who belong to a sharp, 
snappy outfit. Elements of shift orientation - Briefing, show up, 
etc.: 
Duty assignment 
Related circumstances, i.e., warrants, current stolen 
property/vehicle lists, hazardous situations, and special events 
Review importance of geographical knowledge of your jurisdiction.

 Cover the basics of Geography. Stress the importance of learning as much 
as possible before the start of field training 
What are the numbers? 
Why are they different colors? 
Does the dead end on the sign point to the dead end? 
Use the map of Denton to review major city streets, highways, loops 
etc.…… 
Use map as an example of street numbers, direction etc….

There are always Exceptions:
 • Looping, Slashing, and Diagonal Streets/Highways
 • Very useful for cutting through town and faster responses
 • Learn their connecting routes from the major streets
 Final Geography Suggestions
 • Study your city’s map and layout
 • Pay attention when driving & always try to learn…… 
• “What street is that….and……where does it go?”
 • Where are my looping and slashing streets?
 • Short route is NOT always the fastest (time of day & traffic)
 Other Beat Characteristics
 • Pay attention during Pre-shift briefings
 • Learn the “personality” of  your city & district– GET OUT OF THE CAR & get to know your peeps!– Socio-economic & geographic characteristics– Awareness: crime/public safety hazards, special events, known offenders, – Don’t ignore quality of life issues/signs of neighborhood decay/apathy:
 • Abandon houses & code violations / dead, abused, neglected animals
 • Streetlights not working, potholed roads, and un-maintained yards, etc.
 Use slide as example of taking a direct route  
Review the factors involved with making a decision on which route to take.  
35.2 Continued  
Officer should know early on in assignment, the beat’s characteristic 
elements. 
Area and its socio-economic and geographic characteristics 
Conditions 
Crime hazards 
Crimes committed in area 
Knowledge of your assigned area (such as location of streets, 
businesses, schools, hospitals; which way street numbers run; traffic 
routes, i.e., main arterial streets, dead ends, overpasses, back roads, 
one-way streets, and alleyways) increases probability of on-site 
arrest and officer safety. 
Familiarization with known offenders increases the probability of arrest. 
o Their habits and types of crimes 
o Texas Crime Information Center (TCIC)/National Crime 
Information Center (NCIC) information 
35.2 Continued 
Equipment Readiness:
 • Notebook and pen or pencil
 • Firearms(s) & magazines, fully loaded, clean, dry, current, & operational
 • Body armor- should be worn by each officer at all times while on duty
 • Handcuffs - clean & operational with key(s) that are accessible
 • Flashlight(s) and a traffic whistle
 • Foul weather & first aid gear- boots, raincoat, cap cover, gloves, etc.
 Physical Readiness:
 • Uniform and grooming in order & worn properly– Appearance and attitude go together / NO smoking in public– Well maintained duty belt: secure items to avoid “jingle jangle” noise
 • Interview position, good posture, & NO hands in your pockets.
 • Minimize carried items / no stuffed pockets.
 Mental Preparation:
 • Use WIN and mental imagery/rehearsals
 • NO white or black: yellow & transition to orange/red as needed
 • Always checkout/notify dispatch of your activity
 • Always be aware of your gun and other weapons
 • Avoid complacency and extreme paranoia
 • Avoid isolationism and withdrawal from the world
 • Call backup / Don’t perform enforcements alone, unless it’s urgent
 Safety Awareness: Cover v Concealment
 • Cover:  something expected to stop a bullet fired from small arms
 • Cover examples: brick walls, automobile engine, steel US mailboxes, 
large tree trunk, etc.
 • Concealment:  Hides you from view but no protection
 • Concealment examples: shrubs, sheetrock, etc.
 • COVER IS PREFERRED, but If only concealment is available, then use 
the one at the GREATEST DISTANCE POSSIBLE
 Equipment readiness check: 
Vehicle, weapons, radio, fire and first aid gear, etc. 
Report or replace non-working or unsafe equipment. 
Safety Guidelines 
Never approach a potentially dangerous situation without first 
notifying someone (dispatch, supervisor) and, if needed, 
without backup. 
Never go into a building or structure where criminal activity 
is suspected without backup. 
Maintain a constant awareness of the police sidearm. 
Practice good officer-survival techniques day in and day out. 
Knowledge of Cover and Concealment: 
• Cover: Any material that can reasonably be expected to stop the 
travel of a bullet fired from small arms such as handguns, shotguns, 
and rifles that provides an adequate level of protection from 
danger/injury (brick walls, automobile engine, etc.) Cover is 
typically hardened, thick, bulky material. 
• Concealment: Hides you from view but without protection. Any 
object that prevents a person from seeing you is concealment. A 
thick bush, a closed set of window blinds or a shower curtain all 
qualify as concealment. 
Unit Goal: Hazards a peace officer may encounter when on patrol. 
TCOLE’s 3 Kinds of Patrol Hazards
 1.Silhouetting
 2.Telltale Noises
 3.Suspect’s Hands 
(all risk zones are important for proper context)
 Silhouetting: 
• Placing yourself, others, or patrol unit in a position to provide the 
suspect(s) with a definite identifiable target. – Helps suspect(s) with officer #’s, fire power, approach, & allows them to plan– Vehicle stops: select stop locations with proper emergency lighting control– Back-up units secure headlights & other lighting upon approach/arrival– Hold flashlights well in front & away from body & do not point them toward 
other officers– Do not stand in doorways and hallways or peer openly thru broken/open 
windows 
Telltale Noises:
 • Vehicle, engine 
• Parking unit too close to scene 
• Seat belts/pop the buckle 
• Letting unit door slam shut 
• Radio volume too loud 
• Equipment, i.e., radio, keys, whistles, baton, handcuffs, 
portable radio (jingle jangle)
 Suspects’ hands: 
• Demand suspect place hands in front of them and turn palms up. 
• Do not allow subject to put hands in pockets. – Hiding contraband, evidence, or weapon?– Hiding identifiable marks, scars, or tattoos?
 • If hands are already in pockets, do not allow removal 
• Always frisk from behind with the suspect facing away 
• Situational Discretion: have suspect kneel or prone before frisking
 35.4 Determine the various kinds of hazards encountered while on 
patrol. 
35.4. Determine the various kinds of hazards encountered while on 
patrol. 
Silhouetting: 
• Placing yourself, others, or your patrol unit in a position as to provide the 
suspect(s) with a definite identifiable target. 
• Provides suspect(s) with knowledge of how many officers are present, 
f
 ire power, and approach. 
• Allows suspect(s) to plan course of action. 
• Attempt to select location for vehicle stop. 
• Back-up units secure headlights, reds, and ambers upon approach of 
primary unit. 
• Hold flashlight well in front and away from body. Do not point toward 
other officers. 
• Do not stand in doorways and hallways or peer openly through broken or 
otherwise open windows. 
Telltale Noises: 
• Vehicle, engine 
• Parking unit too close to scene 
• Radio volume too loud 
• Seat belts/pop the buckle 
• Letting unit door slam shut 
• Equipment, i.e., radio, keys, whistles, baton, handcuffs, portable radio  
Suspects’ hands: 
• Demand suspect place hands in front of them and turn palms up. 
• Do not allow subject to put hands in pockets. 
• Possibly hiding contraband (evidence) in pockets, weapon, and/or 
identifiable marks, scars, or tattoos. 
• If hands are already in pockets, do not allow removal. 
• Situational Discretion Needed - Suspect to turn head away and/or kneel 
or lay on ground before frisking for weapon. 
Report hazards such as: 
• roadway hazards, dead animals, animals on roadway, traffic control 
devices, crime hazards; and 
• contact appropriate authorities, depending upon the type of hazard, as 
soon as possible. 
Unit Goal: Techniques of patrol. 
2 types of problem area patrols
 • Preventive patrols:– Preventive enforcement:  varied, appropriate, and random– Selective patrol:  specific problems at certain times/locations
 • Apprehension patrol: Low visibility and surveillance

 TCOLE’s Tips for Automobile Patrol
 • Check for mechanical defects, contraband, & weapons
 • Remain alert and prepared for an emergency
 • Do not spend too much time in drive-ins/coffee shops– If another patrol vehicle is there, do not stop.
 • Vehicle conferences should be on main thoroughfares for 
visibility and preventive enforcement
 • Watch driving speed & rules of the road
 • Never leave keys in the vehicle or park on railroad tracks
 35.5. Identify the two types of problem area patrols. 
Preventive Patrol: 
• Preventive Enforcement: Conduct property checks, question suspicious 
persons, vary patrol patterns and predictability and maintain high visibility. 
• Selective patrol: Deals with specific problems or violations, so be aware 
of the problem, the location, and the time of day that the problems usually 
occur. 
Apprehension Patrol 
• Covert or low visibility tactics and techniques - surveillance 
•  Discuss how the modes can be used for the different types of patrols 
•  The ones that don’t really fit how the mode is typically used or can be 
used then it has been removed from the column 
•  Note: some modes have limited used for some that are still listed: 
discuss examples with students 
35.6. Identify the advantages of the six different patrol modes. 
Bicycle Patrol: 
• Advantages: Flexibility where use of motorized vehicles is impractical or 
impossible, allows for high visibility and intense patrol. Many cities and 
college campuses choose bicycle patrol in preventive efforts and to 
improve community relations. 
Motorcycle Patrol: 
• Advantages: Quick response, flexibility to cover large area, can be used 
as escort units, and are effective in traffic law enforcement. 
Foot Patrol: 
• Advantages: Immediate traffic control, person-to-person contact, good 
public/community relations, increased knowledge of physical beat, 
develop informants, increased knowledge of community needs and 
potential crime hazards. 
Automobile Patrol: 
• Advantages: Speed, mobility, visibility increases preventive potential, 
protection of officer, permits officer to carry extra equipment. 
Fixed Wing and Helicopter Patrol:  
• Advantages: Available in emergency situations, can cover enormous area, 
allows sky view of fleeing persons or vehicles, excellent apprehension tool 
when used with ground units. 
Mounted Patrol: 
• Advantages: Person-to-person contact, good public/community relations, 
better mobility in crowded areas, ability to pursue in rough terrain, 
visibility increases in a crowd. 
Tips on Automobile Patrol 
• Check vehicle for mechanical defects, contraband, and weapons before 
beginning patrol. 
• Do not spend too much time in drive-ins or coffee shops; if another 
patrol vehicle is there, do not stop. 
• Conferences between patrol vehicles should be located on main 
thoroughfare where they can be seen; encourages preventive enforcement 
• Watch driving speed and observe rules of the road 
• Never leave keys in the patrol vehicle and never park on railroad tracks 
• Remain alert and prepared for an emergency  
Fixed Wing and Helicopter Patrol: 
• Advantages: Available in emergency situations, can cover enormous area, 
allows sky view of fleeing persons or vehicles, excellent apprehension tool 
when used with ground units. 
Mounted Patrol:  
Various Patrol Methods
 Two Officer Patrol
 One Officer Patrol
 • Having 2x more patrol vehicles on the 
street =  double preventive enforcement.
 • More attention is devoted to patrol 
functions and duties.
 • Officer develops self-reliance, rather 
than depending on a partner for backup.
 • Takes fewer chances in a patrol vehicle
 • Personality clashes are reduced.
 • Greater safety factor.
 • Can be used as a training aid for the 
correction of officer mistakes.
 • Share driving duties.
 • Two pairs of eyes are better than one.
 • One officer can operate the radio 
while the other drives.

 • Give context: communicate 
Police needs & problems– Role– Budget– Crime trends– Police procedures– Legal issues
 • Advantages: Person-to-person contact, good public/community relations, 
better mobility in crowded areas, ability to pursue in rough terrain, 
visibility increases in a crowd.  
35.7. Discuss the various patrol methods. 
One-Officer Patrol: 
• Having twice as many patrol vehicles on the street doubles preventive 
enforcement. 
• When the officer is alone, more attention is devoted to patrol functions 
and duties. 
• An officer alone develops self-reliance, rather than depending on a 
partner for backup. 
• A lone officer in a patrol vehicle takes fewer chances. 
•Personality clashes are reduced. 
Two-Officer Patrol: 
• Has a greater safety factor. 
• Can be used as a training aid for the correction of officer mistakes. 
• Shared driving duties. 
• Two pairs of eyes are better than one. 
•One officer can operate the radio while the other drives. 
35.30. Identify different methods designed to enhance public service. 
Visual presence: 
• Vehicular 
• On foot 
• Other 
Non-punitive interaction with the public: 
• Talking to people Community involvement (on-duty): 
• Public speaking and participation at civic gatherings 
• Civic groups 
• Professional groups 
• Clubs 
• Other service-oriented agencies (YMCA/YWCA, Big Brother/Big Sister, 
Human Services, etc.)

 • Briefly discuss this chart by encouraging students to become aware of 
their communities’ resources, so they can be a good facilitator when 
problems found are NOT a police function 
• Referrals, linking, or bringing in resources to help someone are the 
roles of a true community leader when the problem is not directly 
related to your policing role 
35.31. Identify community resources that can be used for assistance in 
emergencies. 
Emergency Community Resources: 
• Request assistance arising from emergency cases: Ambulance for injured, 
Fire Department, Patrol Transportation 
• Salvation Army 
• Shelters for Battered Spouses/Children 
• Rape Crisis Centers 
• United Way 
• Animal Control Officials 
• City Services 
• Medical Examiner (ME) & Justice of the Peace 
With some people, the best and only way to help is to put them into the 
hands of someone who can do more for them. In this sense, the main 
function is to make appropriate referrals, whether it’s to local, state, of 
federal organizations. Victim service units can assist with referrals. It’s 
important to know where to refer people. 
Instructor Note: The below activity will help the officer locate community 
and agency sources of help, will provide information about them and a 
procedure for obtaining such information. 
Lecture Scenario: Community Resources 
• In advance, identify 4-5 community or agency resources such as drug 
rehabilitation center, mental health center, Alcoholics Anonymous etc. for 
referral sources. 
• Conduct a panel discussion on meeting needs of the public and law 
enforcement. 
• General discussion 
35.8. Demonstrate a proper pedestrian stop. 
Ped Stops & Field Interviews
 When
 • carrying something suspicious 
• acting strangely
 • staying in the same place
 • stopping other people on the street 
• Until you have reasonable suspicion it’s a consensual stop

• acting strangely, 
• staying in the same place, or 
• stopping other people on the street.  
Where 
to perform 
a 
pedestrian 
stop: 
• Take note of escape routes. 
• Gauge the number of people that could be hurt should an incident occur. 
• A place where there would be the least number of hostages possible. 
• Gauge officer safety. 
• Report location to dispatcher.  
How to perform a pedestrian stop: 
• Use effective verbal communications. 
Approach carefully: Maintain visual contact with suspicious person, 
approach on right side since most people are right-handed, watch for 
furtive movements or attempts to flee, establish early eye contact, and 
be aware of surroundings. 
Applicable cases: 
• Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U.S. 567, 108 S. Ct. 1975 (1988)

Can an anonymous tip to a police officer provide reasonable suspicion to a 
Police Officer to permit an investigatory stop? 
Yes- An anonymous tip providing descriptive and  predictive information, if 
sufficiently corroborated by additional police investigation, can provide 
reasonable suspicion.

Application Scenarios
  As you read each scenario below, indicate, if at 
all, when there is reasonable suspicion to 
detain and list the possible offenses that 
could be at play.  
 Also indicate, if you would detain at that point 
or wait.  
 Also indicate, if at all, the moment when there 
is probable cause for an arrest or a warrant.  
Make sure you list your supporting facts that 
justify any belief of reasonable suspicion or 
probable cause. 
10.5. Discuss probable cause and arrest without warrant. 
• An officer may arrest for that offense which the probable cause leads the 
officer to believe is occurring or has occurred. Whether or not probable 
cause was present to support an arrest or search is a question that will be 
resolved by the courts. 
• The court will examine the “totality of the circumstances” surrounding 
the seizure or detention to determine if there were sufficient facts and 
circumstances present to satisfy the Fourth Amendment. 
40
 10 
41
 42
 • Only the information known to the officer at the time of the seizure or 
search will be considered by the court – any evidence found after the 
arrest or during the search will not be admissible to prove probable cause. 
• Although the courts are the ultimate arbiters of what constitutes 
probable cause, the U.S. Supreme Court in the Gates opinion also stated: 
“Perhaps the central teaching of our past decisions bearing on the 
probable cause standard is that it is a practical, non-technical conception. 
In dealing with probable cause…as the very name implies, we deal with 
probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical 
considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men 
(peace officers), not legal technicians (attorneys), act.” 421 U.S. at 231. 
This scale will be used to outline the process of information gathering and 
how it applies to reaching levels of reasonable suspicion and probable 
cause.  
• Practical Application Scenarios 
• Break students into groups to work through ALL of the scenarios. 
• The students’ handouts have only the questions in white on the slide to 
the left. 
• After all groups finish, select different groups to discuss their answers 
for one scenario 
• Ask other groups for their input/agreement with the primary group’s 
answer, which should create some healthy debate and practical 
learning. 
• Once these discussions are complete then pose the questions in blue to 
individual students or ones who volunteer to answer. 
• Use the slides to the left to guide you through each scenario, asking a 
different primary group to respond first before opening it up for other 
groups’ comments. 
Instructor note: When reviewing the answers, walk the students through 
using the CDM as a guide.  
1. At 2200 hours an officer receives a dispatch call of a suspicious 
subject in a neighborhood area of his/her district.  
 The caller told dispatch that the male subject was walking on the sidewalk, wearing 
all black.
  The caller also says that he does not look like he belongs in the area. 
 The caller refused to give a name. 
 Caller explains that she is concerned because her car was burglarized last night.
 43
 1a. At 0700hrs, you pull into the parking lot of 7-11 to get a drink. 
You notice a car is parked in front of the store, right in the middle 
of 2 parking spaces. You enter the store, get your drink and as 
your paying, the woman next to you buys a 4pk of Sutter Home 
wine. She walks out to the car that is parked across 2 spaces. 
When speaking to the clerk and walking to her car, she did not 
display any noticeable signs of intoxication.
  Do you have reasonable suspicion to detain her to investigate?
  She gets in the car and starts the engine. In full uniform, you walk up to her car and 
tap on her window. Is this a detention?
  She rolls down the window, you do not smell any alcohol, she has no slurred speech 
or other signs of intoxication. She says she is late and must go. Do you let her 
leave?
 44
 2. At 1300 hours on a Tuesday in April an officer observes a subject in a 
store parking lot looking into the windows of several parked vehicles. 
 As the officer watches, the subject appears to try the door handles on 2 different cars but never 
makes entry into a vehicle. 
 The subject looks to be a juvenile around the age of 14 to 16, and school is in session.
  A few seconds later the officer sees him go to another vehicle.  He pulls open the vehicle’s driver’s 
side door and crawls inside.  The juvenile begins to rummage around inside the car. 
 When contacted, he says that he has lost his keys and wallet and is trying to find them inside his car.

3. At 2000 hours you are assigned to an affluent 
neighborhood of mostly newly constructed homes. 
 The neighborhood is relatively safe from violent crime, but property crimes (especially burglaries and 
car thefts) have been on a steady rise over the past six months.  While on patrol, you observe two 
late model cars parked in front of a newer home on the block that is for sale.
  Two men are on the porch of the house.  One man is standing in front of the other and seems to be 
struggling with door handle.  The second man seems to be watching him.
 46
 4.  At 0200 hours an officer receives a dispatch call of a suspicious subject walking in the 
parking lot of a business area.  The caller tells dispatch that the male subject is 
wearing all black and is walking in the lot behind the businesses in the strip mall.  The 
caller is an overnight stocker who works inside one of the businesses.  The caller says 
that all the businesses in the area were closed by midnight. 
 Upon your arrival, you see a man, with no shirt and black pants, coming out the back door of one of 
the businesses.  He is carrying a gym bag in his right hand.
  When contacted the subject appears to be very nervous and has what appears to be blood on his 
pants.
  When he sits down his bag, it makes a loud metal clang noise.
  Inside the bag there is a pry bar, screwdrivers, a large hammer, and a bloody shirt.
  After backup arrives, the officer observes fresh pry marks on the business’ back door.

 5.  You are patrolling a neighborhood with small, modest homes, mostly 
developed in the early 1900’s.  The neighborhood area has some vibrant 
commercial avenues, parks, and growing redevelopment.  It has a newly 
developed light rail system that links the once isolated neighborhood with 
downtown.  The neighborhood is comprised of predominantly poor and 
working
class, African
American residents.  The neighborhood continues to 
experience the city’s highest rates of both violent and property crimes.  Within 
the last few weeks, a number of strong
arm robberies, allegedly committed by 
a group of young White males in their twenties, have been reported and remain 
unsolved.  
 At 2345 hours you are patrolling a narrow street of the neighborhood and see a 5’6” Black man 
standing alone on a porch looking up and down the street. He is looking up and down the street, 
peeking his head out and then stepping on and off the porch.

6.  An agent from the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) contacts local police 
about their current investigation of a drug trafficking operation.  Based on wire 
taps and informants, he reports that the distribution ring they are investigating 
are planning to pick up shipments of illegal drugs at various railroad stations in 
the U.S. and Hispanic elderly couples will be used as couriers. 
 Based on this info, can local law enforcement stop, detain, and question Hispanic elderly couples at 
local railroad stations in connection with this investigation? Explain why or why not.
 49
 7.  You are patrolling a historic neighborhood known for its Victorian and 
Craftsman style homes.  Much of the neighborhood is a historic district 
with various commercial shops, restaurants, and bars in the nearby 
renovated downtown area.  The neighborhood is a mixture of affluent to 
middle class families.  While property crime is always a concern, the 
property crime rate is about average for the neighborhood with very little 
violent crime.  At 1210 hours, you are driving through the neighborhood 
at 1210 hours and see a Caucasian woman dressed in a sundress 
looking over a fence. 
 She also appears to be looking around as if not wanting to be seen by others in the area.  She is 
holding a Gucci, red-leather bag. 
50
 8.  You are patrolling the same historic neighborhood from the previous 
scenario (#7).  At 1400 hours dispatch gets three 9-1-1 calls that 
describe three “scraggly looking” teenage males with long hair and 
black skinny jeans.  Callers say that they are currently at 1515 James 
St. taking pictures of the residence, which happens to be the home of 
the police chief.  Callers also reported that the teenagers have been on 
the street and in the yard, taking pictures for about 15 to 20 minutes.

35.10. Discuss the use of the field inquiry. 
Used to learn about people: 
• Subject's reaction to inquiry. 
• How people react to questioning by police. 
• Personal contact with citizens opens relationships for future information. 
• Puts officer on one-to-one basis with public. A vital source of 
information: 
• The people in the area personally know the officer. 
• The officer learns the socio-economic make-up of the people in the area. 
• The officer learns where people work and becomes aware of who the 
store clerks are, what time they travel to and from work, and what types of 
vehicles they drive. 
• People observe and know many things and will tell a good officer who 
has developed proper rapport through field inquiry. 
Used to learn about places: 
• Houses, buildings, and stores have specific observable characteristics. 
• A light on in a building, where none has been before. 
• No attendant at cash register in convenience store. 
• An open or broken window of closed business or home. 
• Suspicious persons in alley or other area where no one usually goes. 
• Broken or missing lock on gate. 
• A light out over a rear or side entrance to a closed building. 
• Vehicles parked in an alley or area where none are usually parked. 
• Tire tracks across lawn to back of building. 
Ped Stops & Field Interviews
 Where
 • Note escape routes & gauge officer safety
 • Limits potential # of hostages 
• If it goes bad, how many could be hurt?
 • Always report your activity 
locations to dispatch
 How
 • Use effective verbal tactics & establish 
early eye contact 
• Maintain visual contact & an overall 
awareness of surroundings
 • On right side: most are right-handed 
• Watch for furtive or fleeing movements
 • Mentally catalog a description in case 
they flee and get away 
Ped Stops Should Be Done Out of the Car
 Which Side Should You Choose?
 Rear
 • + surprise; reduces direct attack probability
 •--- may provoke physical defense (surprise)
 Right Side
 • Preferred side because 
most are right-handed
 Direct/Front
 • + observe all movements
 Right or Left Side
 • + suspect off balance
 •--- Reduced surprise & cannot 
see all movement (other side)
 •--- lose surprise element; vulnerable to resistance
 The Field Interview Position:
 • Gun side away, nothing in the gun hand, and an offset stance– Distance: AT LEAST3-3.5 feet (arm’s length) – Person/situation may dictate more distance– Continually scan the risk zones
 • Explain the beginning of a Ped stop/meet and greet contact 
• Emphasize safe approaches and tactics 
Positioning can vary with the situation, person’s size & disposition 
Approach on right side since most are right-handed 
Direct approach:  
can observe all movements but . . . 
lose surprise element and are vulnerable to resistance 
Rear approach:  
gain surprise & reduces probability of direct attack but . . . 
may provoke physical response in defense of him/herself 
Side approach:  
helps to keep suspect off balance but . . .  
you cannot observe all movement & surprise is reduced 
2 officer approach:   
keep visual contact with each other &  
approach in a spread V formation to avoid a crossfire situation 
• Discuss the mechanics of the ped stop procedure 
• Use the slides and their animations to explain and demo the procedures 
• Emphasize distance: new recruit often lose sight of how close they are 
as they are still in a civilian conversational mindset 
• Tell  them they are in a new role now and distance must be a constant 
and conscious awareness for them on the job 
 
•Your best chance is a continual scanof the:–Face & Chest–Hands–Waistband–and Stance
 The 4 Personal Contact Risk Zones
 57
 Best chance: watch their face & chest, hands, waistband, & stance
 
• Use the slides to explain and illustrate the 4 risk zones to be continually 
scanned 
• Drive home the phrase to help students remember the zones: Your best 
chance is to: watch their face & chest, hands, waistband, & stance.

 • Showing Anxiety or Disinterest?– Crossing arms, tapping fingers, keys, etc.– Repeatedly rubbing the back of the neck, ears, eyes– Grooming: nervous energy . . .  Beware of its context– FACIAL WIPE
 • Anger– Fist making– Flailing hands – Hands raised above waist
 • Discuss hand preferences and how to handle them if they have been in 
the pockets too long 
62
 • Explain the 2nd zone 
• Show the next part of the In-the-Line of Duty video on Body Language 
63
 The Waistband
 • Common place for weapons
 • Can you see the waist/pockets or 
anything on it (shirt/coat covering)?
 • Bulges under the shirt or pockets?
 • Keep their hands from it and below 
(esp. the pockets)
 • Accelerated breathing
 64
 Their Stance
 • Bobbing up & down 
• Rocking back and forth
 • Bladed with shoulders shifted & tense
 • Subject stands tall to maximize height
 • Kicking the ground
 • Pacing / Backing / Walking away
 • Start & Stop behavior / becomes very still
 • EXAGGERATED movements
 • If out of breath: lower of body before final 
attack
 The Field Interview Position:
 • Your positioning should allow movement; don’t get boxed in or trapped
 • Keep them verbally informed of your actions and expectations
 65
 • Explain the 3rd zone 
• Explain the 4th zone 
• Show the last 2 parts of the In-the-Line of Duty video on Body Language 
• Discuss the mechanics of the ped stop procedure 
• Use the slides and their animations to explain and demo the procedures 
• Emphasize distance: new recruit often lose sight of how close they are 
as they are still in a civilian conversational mindset 
• Tell  them they are in a new role now and distance must be a constant 
and conscious awareness for them on the job 
35.9. Demonstrate techniques used while interviewing persons during 
f
 ield operations. 
One Officer with One Person: 
• Field interview position recommends the officer to place gun side away 
and stand approximately one arm's length or more from the person. 
Depending upon the situation and the size and disposition of the person, 
the officer may want to use discretion in positioning. 
• The "gun hand" should remain free when practical. 
• Maintain overall observation of the person. 
• Be aware of surroundings. 
One Officer with Multiple Persons
 • FI position for overall observation & physical control, if needed
 • Interview separately and away from one another
 • Get backup before ANY non-emergency police actions
 • Move as needed to prevent closing in or surrounding you
 2 Officer V-formation Approach
 2 Officers with One or More Persons
 • V approach, plan the contact, & communicate
 • 1 officer in charge, assumes the F.I. position, & gathers info separately 
• 2ndofficer (cover) takes the tactical L position to avoid a crossfire 
• This position can be to the right or left rear of the person 
One Officer with Two or More Persons: 
• Assume the recommended field interview position and speak to the 
person to be interviewed. 
• Stand in a safe position where persons can be restrained if necessary. 
• Maintain overall observation of persons. 
• Move as necessary to prevent persons from closing in or surrounding 
officer.  
Two Officers with One Person: 
• The officer initiating the contact should exercise all the precautions 
noted above. 
• The second officer should take position to the right or left rear of the 
person being interviewed (avoid crossfire situation). 
• One officer should take lead in gathering information.  
Two Officers with Two or More Persons: 
• The officer initiating the contact should proceed as previously described. 
• The second officer assumes a position, which allows maximum visibility 
of the persons, avoid lengthy conversations, which would detract from 
safety awareness, and communicate any observations of threat or hazard 
to the primary officer. 
Practical Scenario: Field Interviewing 
• Break students into small groups. 
• Practice the above techniques. 
Two Officers with One Person:

safety awareness, and communicate any observations of threat or hazard 
to the primary officer. 
Practical Scenario: Field Interviewing 
• Break students into small groups.Practice the above techniques. 
COVER Officer Duties
 cover is NOT the contact 
officer’s servant
 • Keep a position of maximum visibility of ALL involved
 • Avoid lengthy conversations that detract from cover duty
 • Communicate or handle any threat observations
 What do you think?
 What is he looking at? What should he be looking at?
 What do you think of their positioning?
 Contact officers are too Close
 Cover too far around the “L”
 What if a suspect runs…do we pursue?
 • NO: if alone with multiple subjects; broadcast description 
& direction of travel
 • NO: if it leaves your partner in an unsafe situation
 • Otherwise YES if it is safe & within your departmental 
policy
 Foot Pursuit: what to do
 • Radio in a loud, calm, controlled voice– Call sign, foot pursuit, direction, and location– Follow with description of suspect– If you can’t catch……keep in sight & radio updates
 • Watch for ambushes!
 • Don’t cut corners without “pie-ing” them
 • When you catch them: tripping is better than tackling….
 Use the CONTACT & COVER Principle: cover is NOT the contact officer’s 
servant 
Keep a position of maximum visibility of ALL involved 
Avoid lengthy conversations that detract from cover duty 
Communicate or handle any threat observations 
Show the next two slides’ pics and have students comment on what they 
see 
NO: if alone with multiple subjects; broadcast description & direction of 
travel 
NO: if it leaves your partner in an unsafe situation 
Otherwise YES if it is safe & within your departmental policy

Conclusion 
• Q/A session over key areas might be helpful for the students’ retention. 
• Be available for student questions 
• Remind students that they not only need to understand this material 
but be able to apply the material as well 
Presentation 
• Introduce the 5 steps of the CDM 
• The critical decision-making model provides officers with an organized 
way of making decisions about how they will act in any situation, 
including situations that may involve uses of force.  
• Note to the Instructor:  Agencies may adopt the Police Executive 
Research Forum's Integrating Communications, Assessment, and Tactics 
(ICAT) course modules 2, 3, 4, 5, and selected scenarios from module 6 
to meet the learning objectives. PERF ICAT Module 6 does not have to 
be completed in its entirety, only to the extent of completion of this 
curriculums section 6 objectives. If an agency does not adopt the ICAT 
program, the learning objectives listed below must be met by any 
curricula used to instruct de-escalation strategies.  The PERF ICAT 
program including instructor guides, lesson plans, presentations, and 
video links is available for use at this location: 
http://www.policeforum.org/icat-training-guide 
Basic Peace Officer Course │ Chapter 27 │ De-Escalation Strategies 
27.1. Describe the key principles of the Critical Decision-Making Model 
(CDM). 
• Police ethics 
• The values of the police agency 
• Proportionality 
• The sanctity of the human life 
27.2. Explain each of the five steps of the CDM. 
• Step 1: Collect information 
• Step 2: Assess situation, threats, and risks 
• Step 3: Consider police powers and agency policy 
• Step 4: Identify options and determine best course of action 
• Step 5: Act, review, and re-assess 
Critical Decision Making Model
 The Spinning Model
 • Organized method for situational decision-making choices
 • Core of the CDM: your agency’s moral compass
 • Unique to an agency’s missions, values, & ethics
 • NO CDM step should contradict your core
 • Implicit bias: subconscious attitudes or stereotypes 
o It can affect one’s understanding, decisions, & actions
 o It can also influence split-second decision making
 WHAT CAN THE CDM CAN DO FOR US?
  Can help us handle calls more effectively & safely
  Provides an organized & improved approach
  Provides more officer options & techniques to use
  Provides a problem-solving model to plan proactive responses for complex 
community issues 
Step 1: Collect information
 • INFO Collection should be an ongoing process
 • Who are my sources?
 1. Dispatch
 2. Supervisors/officers
 3. Computer networks
 4. Family/friends
 5. Witnesses/neighbors 
• Clarify-consider any ASSUMPTIONS, BIAS, & ACTIONS
 • Describe the key principles of the Critical Decision-Making Model 
(CDM) 
o Police ethics 
o The values of the police agency 
o Proportionality 
o The sanctity of the human life 
•Discuss the importance of the CDM and de-escalation skills 
• Tell students that de-escalation skills will be further discussed and 
developed during the CIT unit 
27.4. Use the CDM to describe the actions of a police officer handling a 
critical incident, through a video case study. 
• Obtain and review a video case study of an actual incident, as seen 
through an officer’s body-camera or dash-cam and analyze how the 
officers’ actions fit with the critical decision-making model (CDM). 
• Include in the class discussion, indicators of the presence of implicit bias. 
• Explain each of the five steps of the CDM 
o Step 1: Collect information 
o Step 2: Assess situation, threats, and risks 
o Step 3: Consider police powers and agency policy 
o Step 4: Identify options and determine best course of action 
o Step 5: Act, review, and re-assess 
• Let the slides guide your instruction and discussion which will have 
some video and audio examples 
• Give as many experiential examples that you have as well  
Step 1: Collect information
 • What do I know about the subject, victim, & location?
 1. Who called – and what prompted the call (PROPER CONTEXT-WHY?)?
 2. Are there weapons, children, or animals on scene?
 3. History: previous calls, MH issues, drug use, violence, arrests
 4. Location dynamics: security/containment?
 • What does my training/experience tell me?
 • What further info do I want or need?
 STEP 1 is FOUNDATIONALLY About
 Obtaining the Proper CONTEXT for the call 
and
 Forming the Optimal MINDSET
 While collecting info, 
do the “legal”math in your head
 Do the facts = reasonable suspicion,  
probable cause, or nothing at all?
 STEP 2: ASSESSING RISK’S KEY QUESTIONS
 1. What is/are the threat or risk(s) and at what level?
  Low / High / Unknown?
  Do I need to take immediate action?
  If not, what more information do I need? 
2. Am I trained and equipped to handle this situation? 
 KEEP COMPLACENCY & EMOTIONS IN CHECK: model the desired behavior
  Avoid malice transfer onto you or others
  ID anything that could make this worse or better?
  Need Supervisor, SWAT, Negotiator, etc.?
 3. What is the source for the subject’s malice or aggression?
 • Explain each of the five steps of the CDM 
o Step 1: Collect information 
o Step 2: Assess situation, threats, and risks 
o Step 3: Consider police powers and agency policy 
o Step 4: Identify options and determine best course of action 
o Step 5: Act, review, and re-assess 
Let the slides guide your instruction and discussion which will have some 
video and audio examples 
Give as many experiential examples that you have as well  
Drive home the importance of this slide for Step 1 of the CDM 
• What is the threat or risk and what level? 
 Person with a knife, behaving erratically 
 A potentially dangerous encounter for officers and the 
public 
 Questionable context provided from the 1st call 
• If not, what more information do I need? 
 Crisis Issues (mental health or substance abuse)? 
 Threat level: (keep collecting intel)? 
• Am I trained and equipped to handle this situation?  
 Need other resources? 
 Supervisor, Specialized units (SWAT/negotiators/K9), other 
agencies? 
A WORKING STRATEGY SHOULD START 
DEVELOPING DURING STEP 2
 1. Assessing the level of threat/risks
 1) What means does he have?
 2) Ability (mental & emotional functioning?)
 3) Opportunity (potential or imminent threat: can you reduce/avoid the 
opportunity)
 4) Intent: what is he doing with the weapon (offensive or defensive actions)
 2. What can we do to:
 1) Minimize risk to the victim, public, scene, subject, & officers?
 2) Allow for a safe detention & arrest or evidence recovery/preservation? 
OR Is immediate action needed
 3)
 STEP 3: CONSIDER POLICE AUTHORITY & POLICY
 1. Under what legal authority am I here?  
2. Is this even a matter for the police?
 3. What legal powers do I have to take action? 
4. What agency policies control my response? 
5. Are there others I should be notifying to respond?
 STEP 4: ID OPTIONS & 
CHOOSE THE BEST ONE
 1. Do I have to act now (spin forward) or can spin back to collect 
more info? 
• CDM is a circular & continuous process / tool for successful decision 
making
 • “Model Spinning” UP OR BACK may occur at any point: things can 
change quickly
 • Do I have all the info I need to act now? 
2. Tactical repositioning / containment /  continued communication? 
• Vigilance, active listening, & communication are SO VITAL
 STEP 4: ID OPTIONS & 
CHOOSE THE BEST ONE
 1. Which options best fit my priorities (core principles of my CDM)? 
2. How proportional is the response for the totality of the 
situation?
 • Greatest likelihood of success against least harm
 If you have time, the CDM helps you use your time 
effectively
 • “Why use a sledgehammer to crack a nut?” (Sgt. Jim Young, Police Scotland)
 3. What are the back-up plans/contingencies for the option being considered?
 STEP 5: TAKE YOUR BEST ACTION AND 
MONITOR/ASSESS THE RESULTS
 • Did it resolve the situation?       OR
 • Lessons learned should be applied in the 
future
 • Do I need to “Spin the Model” to another 
step and keep working?
 • Self reflection should occur after its over: 
lessons learned?
 • Discuss the strategies of step 2 planning 
• Discuss step 3 
• Discuss Step 4 
• Discuss the completion of the case study   
• Discuss Step 4 
• Discuss the completion of the case study 
• Discuss step 5 
CRITICAL DECISION-MAKING MODEL (CDM)
 THE BENEFITS OF THE CDM 
• Organizes & provides structure to the decision-making process, which helps 
officers make better decisions
 • “Spinning model” acknowledges the need for urgent or split-second decisions
 • Assists officers in reporting their actions via a structured, rational, and credible 
explanation. 
 “First, I collected the following information ….”
  “Next, I assessed the threats and risks, and developed a working strategy ….”
  “Then, I considered applicable laws and agency policies….” 
QUESTIONS?
 27.3. Articulate the benefits of the CDM. 
• Organize the decision-making process 
• Assists officers to make better decisions 
• Assists officers in explaining their actions after the incident to provide a 
structured, rational explanation increasing credibility. 
Conclusion 
• Q/A session over key areas might be helpful for the students’ 
retention. 
• Encourage students to stay vigilant in their careers for signs of 
apathy, pessimism, isolation, and negative police subculture 
elements in their work and personal lives. 
• Avoid the us against them mentality and remember that MOST of 
the public supports and believes in them and their efforts.
