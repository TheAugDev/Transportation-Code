SECTION 5.2 – CHAPTER 547 - VEHICLE EQUIPMENT 
BPOC Objective 22.17 – Given a driving situation, determine if a violation exists as it applies to vehicle 
equipment standards and maintenance. 
547.001 – Definitions 
(2-b) Highway maintenance or construction vehicle –  a highway or traffic maintenance or construction 
vehicle used for a variety of roadway maintenance and repair activities – includes motor graders, road 
rollers, excavators, pneumatic tire equipment, movers, and tractors. 
Why is this important?  These vehicles fall under special lighting regulations determined by TXDOT (per 
547.105).  These regulations allow these vehicles to flash blue lights that would otherwise be illegal. 
TXDOT has designated a list of vehicles that should be considered highway maintenance or 
construction vehicles:  
Source:  TXDOT Lighting Standards for Highway Maintenance or Construction Vehicles and Service Vehicles 
(3)  Light transmission – the ratio of the amount of light that passes through a material to the amount of 
light that falls on the material and the glazing (expressed as a percentage of light transmitted). 
Why is this important?  This is the standard used for determining the legality of window tint on 
certain windows in 547.613. 
(5-a) Road Machinery – in order to be “road machinery”, the vehicle must be both designed as 
machinery and “only incidentally operated on the highway”.   
Why is this important?  This definition is important because a person operating a road machine is 
not required to hold a Texas driver’s license (521.027) and road machinery is excluded from most 
equipment requirements found in this chapter (547.002). 
(6)  Safety glazing material – material that prevents a window such as a windshield from shattering and 
reduces the likelihood of injury.

(6-a) Service vehicle – a highway or traffic maintenance vehicle owned and operated on a highway by or 
for a governmental agency and performs a function requiring the use of a lamp or illuminating device in 
accordance with TXDOT’s lighting standards adopted in 547.105.  Also includes vehicles that have a 
public service function such as utility vehicles and tow trucks. 
TXDOT has designated a list of vehicles that should be considered service vehicles: 
Source:  TXDOT Lighting Standards for Highway Maintenance or Construction Vehicles and Service Vehicles 
Why is this important?  These vehicles fall under special lighting regulations determined by TXDOT (per 
547.105).  These regulations allow these vehicles to flash blue lights that would otherwise be illegal. 
(7) Slow-moving vehicle  
A. a motor vehicle designed to operate at a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour or less, not 
including an electric personal assistive mobility device (i.e. Segway);  or 
B. a vehicle, implement of husbandry, or machinery, that is towed by an animal or a motor vehicle 
designed to operate at a maximum speed of 25 miles per hour or less.  
Why is this important?  These vehicles are required to display a slow moving vehicle emblem 
(547.703) and they are permitted to operate on the improved shoulder (545.058). 
(8) Slow-moving-vehicle emblem – means a triangular emblem that conforms to standards and 
specifications adopted by the director of DPS (done through DPS administrative code). 
Why is this important?  These emblems may only be used in  certain circumstances (547.005) and 
they are required to be used on slow moving vehicles (547.703). 
Administrative Code Title 43, Part 1, Rule 21.9 – Texas adopted the American Society of Agricultural 
and Biological Engineers, Standard S276 as the standard for slow-moving vehicle emblems used in 
Texas. 
(9) Sunscreening device – a film, material, or device that meets the department's standards for reducing 
effects of the sun. 
Why is this important?  Sunscreening devise are regulated in 547.613 – they cannot block too much 
light on certain windows and they cannot reduce or obstruct the driver’s clear view. 
547.002 – Applicability  
Unless a vehicle equipment provision is specifically made applicable, Chapter 547 does not apply to: 
1) an implement of husbandry (except 547.371 and 547.372) 
2) road machinery (defined in 547.001(5-a)) 
3) a road roller (included in “special mobile equipment” definition in 541.201(18)) 
4) a farm tractor (except 547.371 and 547.372) 
5) a bicycle, a bicyclist, or bicycle equipment (governed by 551.104)

Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            BPOC Student Manual - Page 151 
6) an electric bicycle, an electric bicyclist, or electric bicycle equipment (governed by 551.104) 
7) a golf cart (governed by Chapter 551) 
8) a neighborhood electric vehicle (governed by Chapter 551) 
9) an off-highway vehicle (governed by Chapter 551A) 
 
Apply It: 
 
You come across the farm tractor operating on the highway. 
547.323 says a motor vehicle must be equipped with stop lamps.  
The farm tractor is not equipped with stop lamps. 
547.501 says a motor vehicle must be equipped with a horn.          
The farm tractor is not equipped with a horn. 
547.613 says a windshield may not be tinted.                                      
The farm tractor has dark tint on its windshield. 
How man violations is the operator of the farm tractor committing? 
 
 
547.003 – Equipment Not Affected 
This chapter does not prohibit and the department by rule may not prohibit the use of equipment 
required by an agency of the United States or a part or accessory not inconsistent with this chapter or a 
rule adopted under this chapter. 
Translation: The TRC does not list all permitted equipment and activities.  It only lists required 
equipment and prohibited activities.  When it comes to accessory equipment, the question is not, 
“Where does the Transportation Code say you can have that piece of equipment?”  The question is, 
“Where does the Transportation Code say you can’t have that piece of equipment?”  
Apply It:  
The owner of this truck has been down to the AutoZone 
and you see him driving around with green lights 
glowing under his vehicle. 
You search the Transportation Code and the federal 
lighting standards and you can’t quite put your finger 
on where it specifically says this is a violation.  What 
should you do? 
 
a)  stop him for “Use Equipment Not Approved” because the TRC never says he can have these lights. 
b)  stop him for “Operate Vehicle In Unsafe Condition” because the lights are distracting other drivers. 
c)  stop him and tell him that his lights are illegal.  Release him without a citation because you couldn’t 
find the violation in the ticket writing software. 
d)  Do not stop him because there is no violation.  Buy stock in AutoZone, because once everyone else 
sees these lights they’re going to have to have some, too. 
547.004 – General Offenses 
(a)(1) describes the offense of Drive/Permit To Drive Vehicle In Unsafe Condition So As To Endanger 
Any Person.  This offense occurs when the person operates or moves or, as an owner, knowingly 
permits another to operate or move, a vehicle that is unsafe so as to endanger a person.  This is an 
offense of articulation – an officer must articulate what is unsafe about the vehicle’s condition.  
(a)(2) and (3) describe the offense of Use Equipment Not Approved – the vehicle is not equipped in a 
manner that complies with the vehicle equipment standards and requirements established by this 
chapter or is equipped in a manner prohibited by this chapter.  
Specifically adopted equipment standards can be found in Chapter 21 of the Texas Department of Public 
Safety’s administrative code.  Before taking enforcement action for unapproved equipment, officers 
should be able to identify the applicable equipment standard and how the specific equipment is in 
violation.  
Case law – Carrillo v. State, 235 SW 3d 353, Kennedy v. State (No. 13-12-00668-CR) – courts have held 
that a vehicle driving on a deflated or flat tire could be considered to be in violation of 547.004 and 
548.604.  Note that in each case, officers were able to articulate how the condition of the vehicle was 
unsafe considering the speed the vehicle was traveling, the roadway and traffic conditions, etc.  
547.005 – Offense Relating to Violation of Special-Use Provisions 
(a) A person may not use a slow-moving vehicle emblem on a stationary object or on a non-slow-moving 
vehicle. 
Slow-moving vehicle emblem is defined in 547.001(8) – a triangular emblem that 
conforms to standards and specifications adopted by the director under Section 547.104.  
DPS administrative code adopted the American Society of Agricultural and Biological 
Engineers, Standard S276 as the standard for slow-moving vehicle emblems in Rule 21.9. 
(b) A person may not operate a motor vehicle bearing the words "school bus" unless the vehicle is used 
primarily to transport persons to or from school or a school-related activity. 
547.105 – Maintenance & Service Vehicle Lighting Standards 
This statue gives TXDOT broad authority to regulate the lighting of highway maintenance or construction 
vehicles and service vehicles.  TXDOT has developed lighting standards for these vehicles.  The lighting 
standards can be found on TXDOT’s website:   
https://www.ttsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TxDOT-Equipment-Lighting-Standards_final.pdf 
TXDOT’s lighting standards require flashing amber lights and permit flashing blue lights on highway 
maintenance or construction vehicles and service vehicles in specific circumstances.  Flashing red or 
white lights are prohibited.

547.306 – LED Ground Effect Lighting Equipment on Motorcycle or Moped 
LED ground effect lighting on motorcycles or mopeds may only be non-flashing amber or white light. No 
other colors are permitted. This section is specific to ground effect lighting on motorcycles and mopeds.   
547.3215 – Use of Federal Standard 
This statue was adopted in 1997 and is retro-active to the date the federal lighting standards were first 
written (model year 1968).  The federal lighting standards reference 49 CFR 571.108. The adoption of 
the federal lighting standard means any vehicle manufactured since 1968 must be equipped with lights 
that conform to the federal manufacturer’s lighting standards in effect at the time the vehicle was 
manufactured, not the standards in the Transportation Code.  Oftentimes the standards are the same 
or very similar, however on issues of light performance, mounting height, color, and number, the federal 
lighting standard controls.   
Resource – THP-68 – this form is a concise synopsis of the federal lighting standards.   
The entirety of the 571.108 lighting standard may be viewed online here. 
Application:  Because Texas adopted the Federal Lighting Standards, when officers are examining a 
specific required lamp and determining if it is the correct color, is mounted at the correct height, and 
otherwise is a “legal” light, they should apply the standards found in 49 CFR 571.108 at the time the 
vehicle was manufactured.  A lamp that is not in compliance with the federal standards constitutes a 
violation in Texas for which law enforcement officers can take enforcement action.  
Example: 
The Texas Transportation Code states headlamps must be mounted from 24 to 54 inches. 
The Federal 108 Lighting Standard states headlamps must be mounted from 22 to 54 inches. 
You are looking at a 2016 Ford Focus with headlamps mounted 23 inches high.  Is this a violation? 
No – because the vehicle was manufactured under the federal lighting standard. 
You are looking at a 1964 Plymouth Barracuda with headlamps mounted 23 inches high.  Is this a 
violation? 
Yes – the vehicle was manufactured before the Federal 108 Lighting Standard was introduced in 
1968.  The headlamps must be mounted according to the specifications in the Transportation Code. 
Impairing the Effectiveness of a Required Lamp 
The Federal 108 Lighting Standards has an important provision in Section 6.2.1, which states, “No 
additional lamp, reflective device, or other motor vehicle equipment is permitted to be installed that 
impairs the effectiveness of lighting equipment required by this standard.” 
A vehicle owner who has added accessory lighting or otherwise equipped their vehicle in a manner that 
impairs the effectiveness of the vehicle’s required lights commits this violation – this would apply to 
vehicle modifications such as smoked taillamp covers, tinted headlamp lenses, stickers or decals 
obstructing the high-mounted stop lamp, a bright accessory light that obscures a side marker lamp, etc. 
The arrest title for this violation is Vehicle Equipped so as to Impair the Effectiveness of Required 
Lamp, FMVSS 571.108.

547.321 – Headlamps Required  
Texas TRC Requirements for Headlamps (standard for pre-1968 vehicles) 
A motor vehicle must be equipped with at least two headlamps – one headlamp must be mounted on 
each side of the front of the vehicle and each headlamp must be mounted at a height from 24 to 54 
inches. 
Federal Lighting Standard for Headlamps for All Passenger Cars, Multipurpose Passenger Vehicles 
(MPV), Trucks, and Buses, THP-68, Table 1-A 
547.322 – Taillamps Required 
Because required lamps are address in the Transportation Code AND the Federal 108 Lighting Standard, 
the requirements will be listed separately in this manual. 
Texas TRC Requirements for Taillamps (standard for pre-1968 vehicles)

547.326 – Minimum Lighting Equipment Required 
This is the catch-all minimum lighting requirement for a vehicle operated on the highway at night or 
when visibility is reduced below 1000 feet.   
It applies to vehicles that are otherwise not required to have specific lights and even applies to the 
vehicles that are otherwise exempt from Chapter 547 per 547.002 (Applicability).  This section also 
applies to animal drawn vehicles. 
These vehicles shall be equipped at the times specified in Section 547.302(a) (nighttime and when 
visibility is reduced below 1000 feet): 
1) one white lamp visible at a distance of at least 1,000 feet from the front  
2) two red lamps visible at a distance of at least 1,000 feet from the rear; or  
3) one red lamp visible at a distance of 1,000 feet from the rear and two red reflectors visible at a 
distance of 100 to 600 feet to the rear. 
547.327 – Spotlamps Permitted 
Spot lamps are permitted, not required.  A motor vehicle may be equipped with not more than two 
spotlamps.  A spotlamp shall be aimed so that no part of the high-intensity portion of the beam strikes 
the windshield, window, mirror, or occupant of another vehicle in use. 
547.328 – Fog Lamps Permitted 
Fog lamps are permitted, not required.  No more than two fog lamps may be present, they must be 
mounted between 12 – 30 inches, and may be used in conjunction with low beam headlamps. 
Fog lamps are not defined in the TRC or in the Federal Lighting Standard, however they are described in 
detail in the SAE J583.  This document was adopted in DPS Admin Code (Rule 21.2) and requires that a 
fog lamp be white or yellow.  Fog lamps of any other color are consider to be the wrong color. 
Word Association:  fog lamps   no more than 2  12-30 inches  white or yellow 
547.330 – Auxiliary Driving Lamps Permitted 
A motor vehicle may be equipped with no more than two auxiliary driving lamps mounted on the front 
of the vehicle at a height from 16 to 42 inches.  They may be used with headlamps as long as they are 
used in compliance with 547.333, which requires that the lowermost distribution of light from 
headlamps and auxiliary driving lamps be selected when within 500 feet of an approaching vehicle and 
300 feet when following another vehicle.  The lowermost distribution of light would be low beams on, 
high-beams and auxiliary lamps off.   
BPOC Student Manual - Page 170 
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
In other words, an LED light bar or other auxiliary driving lamp would have to be mounted between 16 
and 42 inches and it could only be used with the high-beam headlights in situations where high-beam 
headlights are authorized. 
Auxiliary Driving Lamps are not defined in the TRC or the Federal Lighting Standard, however they are 
described by SAE engineering code J-581 (adopted in Texas by administrative code – Title 37, Part 1, 
Rule 21.2).  
Based on the definition for auxiliary driving lamp adopted by administrative code (J581 above), auxiliary 
driving lamps are not intended to be used alone or with lower beam headlamps, therefore such use is 
improper and in violation of 547.330. 
J581 also requires that Auxiliary Driving Lamps be white in color.   
Enforcement Guidance: The THP enforcement guidance for these lamps is that enforcement action 
should only be taken if the lamp is turned on and used improperly.  Lamps that are turned off, even if 
improperly mounted, should not be used as PC for stops. 
Word Association:  auxiliary driving lamps   no more than 2  16-42 inches  white  with high
beams only 
DPS Arrest titles: 
Improper Use Of Auxiliary Driving Lamps 
Too Many (More Than Two) Auxiliary Driving Lamps 
Improperly Placed Auxiliary Driving Lamp 
547.331 – Hazard Lamps Permitted 
Texas TRC Requirements for Hazard Lamps (standard for pre-1968 vehicles):   
Hazard lamps are permitted but not required on smaller vehicles (they are, however, required on larger 
vehicles, per 547.352).  Lamps should be visible at a distance of at least 500 feet in normal sunlight and 
shall display simultaneously flashing lights that emit a white or amber light to the front of the vehicle 
and red or amber light to the rear of the vehicle. 
Word Association:  hazard lamps   500’ visibility  white or amber to front  red or amber to rear 
Federal Lighting Standard Requirements for Hazard Lamps, 571.108 - S6.6.2: All vehicles to which this 
standard applies except trailers and motorcycles must be equipped with a vehicular hazard warning 
operating unit.  This device should cause all the turn signal lamps to flash on the vehicle. 
BPOC Student Manual - Page 171 
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
547.332 – Other Lamps Permitted 
The TRC permits a backup lamp in this section, however the Federal 108 Lighting Standard requires a 
backup lamp – THP-68, Table 1A (p.3).  The lamp must be white and It is a violation for the backup lamp 
to be activated when the vehicle is in forward motion.  Most vehicles are manufactured with two backup 
lamps, however only one is required. 
If a vehicle’s backup lamps are activated when the vehicle is in forward motion, a violation exists. This 
would include any auxiliary or supplemental backup lamps added to the rear of a vehicle. 
This section also permits not more than two white or amber side cowl or fender lamps and not more 
than two white or amber running board lights. 
547.333 – Multiple-beam Lighting Equipment Required 
A headlamp, auxiliary driving lamp, auxiliary passing lamp, or combination of those lamps mounted on a 
motor vehicle shall be arranged so that the operator can select at will between uppermost and 
lowermost distributions of light. 
Uppermost distribution of light – reveal a person or vehicle at a distance of at least 450 feet  
Lowermost distribution of light – reveal a person or vehicle at a distance of at least 150 feet ahead, and 
is aimed so that no part of the high-intensity portion of the beam projects into the eyes of an 
approaching vehicle operator. 
High-beam headlamps (uppermost distribution) must be dimmed: 
• When approaching another vehicle within 500 feet from the front. 
• When approaching another vehicle within 300 feet from the rear. 
Word Association:  dim high-beam headlamps   500’ approaching from front (meeting)  300’ 
approaching from rear (following) 
547.334 – Single-Beam Lighting Equipment Permitted 
A single-beam headlamp system (i.e. no high-beam/low-beam) is permitted for farm tractors and motor 
vehicles manufactured before September 4, 1948. 
This single-beam system must reveal a person or vehicle at a distance of 200 feet.

vehicle's rear shall display red flags that are at least 12 inches square, mark the extremities of the load, 
and are placed where a lamp is required by this section.   
Reference 621.206 – Maximum Extended Length of a Load – generally speaking, a vehicle’s load may not 
extend beyond 4’ to the rear of the vehicle.  Having the load marked in accordance with 547.382 does 
not make a load extension beyond 4’ legal.  There are numerous exceptions to the maximum load length – in these situations, the load must be lighted or marked in accordance with 547.382. 
547.383 – Lighting Requirements on Parked Vehicles 
Parking lamps must emit a white or amber light visible to 1,000 feet to the front of the vehicle and a 
red light visible to 1,000 feet to the rear of the vehicle.  The taillamps serve as the parking lamps to the 
rear. 
The federal 108 lighting standard has specifications for parking lamps – THP-68, Table 1-A  
Parking lamps are required to be used when a vehicle is parked or stopped on a roadway or shoulder at 
a time specified in section 547.302(a) (nighttime or when visibility is reduced below 1,000 feet) unless 
there is sufficient light to reveal a person or vehicle on the highway at a distance of 1,000 feet.   
Headlamps on a parked vehicle are required to be dimmed.

Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
547.401 – Brakes Required 
A motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, pole trailer, or combination of those vehicles must be equipped with 
brakes that comply with the performance requirements for brakes.  The performance standards can be 
found in 547.408. 
There are exceptions for certain trailers, semitrailers, or pole trailers: 
1) Trailer gross weight is 4,500 or less – no brakes required 
2) Trailer gross weight is between 4,500 and 15,000 pounds – no brakes required if speed does not 
exceed 30 MPH 
3) Trailer gross weight is between 4,500 and 15,000 pounds at speeds over 30 MPH – brakes 
required only on rear axle (this exception comes from 547.402). 
Note: When it comes to trailer brakes and the various weights utilized in these sections, everything is 
“gross weight” – i.e. actual weight.  This makes sense.  The actual weight of the vehicle going down the 
road is what is important when it comes to stopping the vehicle.  Brakes don’t care how much weight a 
vehicle was designed to carry (Gross Vehicle Weight Rating). They just care how much weight they’re 
going to have to stop. 
547.402 – Operation and Maintenance of Brakes 
(a)  Brakes are required to operate on each wheel of a vehicle except for the following vehicles:  
1) special mobile equipment (defined in 541.201(18)) 
2) a vehicle that is towed as a commodity when at least one set of the towed vehicle's wheels is on 
the roadway (saddle mount method);  and  
3) a trailer with a gross weight heavier than 4,500 pounds but not heavier than 15,000 pounds 
drawn at a speed of more than 30 miles per hour is only required to have brakes on both wheels 
of the rear axle. 
(b)  A truck or truck-tractor that has at least three axles is not required to have brakes on the front 
wheels.  If the truck or truck-tractor has at least two steerable axles, brakes must operate on the wheels 
of at least one steerable axle. 
(c)   A trailer with a gross weight of 15,000 pounds or less may use surge or inertia brakes. 
(d)  Brakes shall be maintained in good working order and adjusted to operate on wheels on each side of 
the vehicle as equally as practicable.  Brake performance standards can be found in 547.408. 
547.403 – Service Brakes Required 
“Service Brakes” are the vehicle’s primary brakes.  The vehicle must be designed to have one control 
mechanism to control all the brakes simultaneously.  In other words, when you press the brake pedal all 
of the brakes should operate. 
An additional control device may be used to operate the brakes on the towed vehicle (i.e. an electric 
brake controller). 
BPOC Student Manual - Page 182 
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
547.404 – Parking Brakes Required 
The parking brake should operate independently of the service brakes and should be capable of 
operating in case of service brake failure.  It should also be capable of holding the vehicle in a parked 
position regardless of roadway slope.  This section does not apply to a motorcycle or moped. 
547.405 – Emergency Brakes Required 
(d)  A trailer, semitrailer, or pole trailer that is equipped with air or vacuum brakes or that has a gross 
weight heavier than 4,500 pounds must be equipped with brakes that operate on all wheels required to 
have brakes that are promptly applied automatically and remain applied for at least 15 minutes in case 
of a breakaway from the towing vehicle. 
Sec. 547.501 – Audible Warning Devices 
(a)  A motor vehicle is required to be equipped with a horn in good working condition that emits a sound 
audible under normal conditions at a distance of at least 200 feet. 
(b)  A vehicle may not be equipped with and a person may not use on a vehicle a siren, whistle, or bell 
unless the vehicle is a commercial vehicle that is equipped with a theft alarm signal or an authorized 
emergency vehicle that is equipped with a siren, whistle, or bell. 
Note: “siren” “whistle” and “bell” are not defined in the Texas Transportation Code or the 
administrative code.  We are left to rely on “common” definitions for these items, which can make 
enforcement somewhat difficult.  Enforcement action would be appropriate for equipment that mimics 
the siren of an emergency vehicle or the whistle of a train. 
(c) and (d) A horn should only be used to provide warning when necessary to ensure safe operation and 
may not emit an unreasonably loud or harsh sound or a whistle. 
Word Association:  Audible warning device   200 feet  no siren, whistle, or bell 
Sec. 547.502 – Visible Warning Devices Required 
A truck, bus, or truck-tractor or a motor vehicle towing a house trailer, when outside an urban district 
or on a divided highway, shall carry in the vehicle: 
During daytime – at least two red flags at least 12 inches square and standards 
to support the flags.  
During nighttime – at least three flares and at least three red-burning fuses, red 
electric lanterns, or portable red emergency reflectors.

547.503 – Display of Hazard Lamps 
This section applies only to trucks, buses, truck-tractors, trailers, semitrailers, or pole trailers that are at 
least 80” wide or 30 feet long.  
The operator of one of these vehicles that is stopped on a roadway or shoulder shall immediately 
display vehicular hazard warning lamps, unless the vehicle is: 
1) parked lawfully in an urban district 
2) stopped lawfully to receive or discharge a passenger 
3) stopped to avoid conflict with other traffic 
4) stopped to comply with a direction of a police officer or an official traffic-control device;  or 
5) displays other warning devices as required (red triangles, flares, flags, etc.) 
 
 
547.504 – Display of Devices When Lighted Lamps Required 
This section applies only to vehicles that are at least 80” wide or 30 feet long stopped or disabled on a 
roadway outside an urban district at night or when visibility is reduced below 1000 feet.   
(b)  If stopped in the roadway for more than 10 minutes, warning devices must be displayed in specific 
locations: one at the left rear of the vehicle, one in the center of the lane 100’ behind the vehicle, and 
one in the center of the lane 100’ ahead of the vehicle. 
 
 
(c)  If the vehicle is disabled or stopped for more than 10 minutes on a roadway of a divided highway at 
night or in times of reduced visibility, the warning devices should be placed in a different manner:  one 
at the left rear of the vehicle, one in the center of the lane 100’ behind the vehicle, and one in the 
center of the lane 200’ behind the vehicle. 
 
 
In roadway more than 10 minutes at night 
In roadway on divided highway more than 10 minutes at night

547.505 – Display of Devices When Lighted Lamps Are Not Required 
This section applies only to vehicles that are at least 80” wide or 30’ long.  When such vehicles are 
disabled or stopped for more than 10 minutes on a roadway outside an urban district during the 
daytime, the operator shall display two red flags in a specified manner.   
(b)  Daytime – Two way roadways: 
 
 
(c)  Daytime – One way roadways: 
 
 
547.601 – Safety Belts Required 
A motor vehicle required by Chapter 548 to be inspected is required to be equipped with front safety 
belts if safety belt anchorages were part of the manufacturer's original equipment on the vehicle.   
 
547.602 – Mirrors Required 
A motor vehicle is required to be equipped with a mirror located to reflect to the operator a view of the 
highway for a distance of at least 200 feet from the rear of the vehicle. 
Word Association:  mirror required   200 foot view 
 
547.603 – Windshield Wipers Required 
A motor vehicle is required to be equipped with a device that cleans moisture from the windshield.  The 
device shall be maintained in good working condition. 
 
547.604 – Muffler Required 
(a)  A motor vehicle is required to be equipped with a muffler in good working condition that continually 
operates to prevent excessive or unusual noise.   
(b)  A person may not use a muffler cutout, bypass, or similar device on a motor vehicle 
Reference 541.203(3) – "Muffler" means a device that reduces noise using:  (A)  a mechanical design, 
including a series of chambers or baffle plates, to receive exhaust gas from an internal combustion 
engine;  or (B)  turbine wheels to receive exhaust gas from a diesel engine. 
547.605 – Emission System Required 
The engine and power mechanism of a motor vehicle is required to be equipped and adjusted to 
prevent the escape of excessive smoke or fumes.   
The owner or operator of a motor vehicle of a model year after 1967 that is equipped with an exhaust 
emission system shall maintain the system in good working condition, shall use the system when the 
motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine is operated, and may not remove the system or a part of the 
system or intentionally make the system inoperable in this state. 
Roadside enforcement of this section is typically taken under (d).  Except when travel conditions require 
the downshifting or use of lower gears to maintain reasonable momentum, a person commits an 
offense if the vehicle: 
1) emits visible smoke for 10 seconds or longer, or  
2) emits visible smoke that remains suspended in the air for 10 seconds or longer before dissipating.   
Word Association:  exhaust emission system   after 1967   10 seconds or longer 
547.606 – Safety Guards or Flaps Required 
This section applies to a vehicle that has at least four tires or at least two super single tires on the 
rearmost axle.  The following vehicles are subject to this section: 
• road tractors 
• trucks (including light trucks) 
• trailers 
• truck-tractors in combination with a semitrailer, or  
• semitrailers in combination with a towing vehicle 
Note: “super single” is defined in this section – a wide-base, single tire that may be used in place of two 
standard tires on the same axle.  Not just a wide tire – it is a wide tire that replaces two standard tires. 
The vehicles described by this section shall be equipped with safety guards or flaps that are of a type 
prescribed by the department and are located and suspended behind the rearmost wheels of the 
vehicle or combination of vehicles within eight inches of the surface of the highway.  
The language “of a type prescribed by the department” means there is administrative code with more 
detail on safety guards/mud flaps. 
Reference Administrative Code – Title 37, Chapter 21, Rule 21.4 
BPOC Student Manual - Page 186 
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
The administrative code grants an additional 4” tolerance for the height requirement, effectively 
meaning safety guards/flaps are only required to come within 12” of the roadway surface when the 
vehicle is standing still. 
Administrative Code Standards for Safety Guards/Mud Flaps: 
1) Suspended within eight inches of the surface of the roadway with a tolerance of four inches. 
2) Must be at least as wide as the tires they are protecting. 
3) Must be made of material capable of remaining in place while the vehicle is being operated. 
4) Must remain in proper place behind rear wheels and must be rigid enough to prevent debris 
from being transmitted to the windshield of the following vehicle. 
5) Must not be split or torn to the extent that it is ineffective. 
6) May swing upwards and backwards while the vehicle is moving, so long as the safety guard or 
flap continues to block the trajectory of debris. 
Safety Guard/Mud Flap Exceptions 
There are four exceptions to the safety guard/mud flap requirement.  Two are found in 547.606 and 
two are described in the above referenced administrative code.  The vehicles that are not required to 
have safety guards/flaps: 
1) Truck-Tractors operated alone 
2) Pole Trailers 
3) Recreational Vehicles (admin code) 
4) Buses (admin code)  
Apply It:

547.609 – Required Label for Sunscreening Devices 
A sunscreening device must have a label that is legible and contains information 
required by the department on light transmission and luminous reflectance of the 
device. 
If the device is placed on or attached to a windshield or a side or rear window, the 
label must state that the light transmission of the device is consistent TRC 
requirements.  The label must be permanently installed between the material and 
the surface to which the material is applied.  
The label must be installed at least on the driver’s window (not required on each individual window).  
Reference DPS Administrative Code Title 37, Part 1, Rule 21.3(f) 
Reference 547.001(9) – "Sunscreening device" means a film, material, or device that meets the 
department's standards for reducing effects of the sun. 
Note: A person in the business of installing window tint is required to place this label and commits an 
offense if they fail to do so (see 547.613(a-1)). 
547.611 – Use of Certain Video Equipment and Television Receivers 
A motor vehicle may be equipped with video receiving equipment, including a television, a digital video 
disc player, a videocassette player, or similar equipment, only if the equipment is located so that the 
video display is not visible from the operator's seat unless the vehicle's transmission is in park or the 
vehicle's parking brake is applied.   
Exceptions – equipment used: 
1) exclusively for receiving digital information for commercial purposes; 
2) exclusively for a safety or law enforcement purpose; 
3) in a remote television transmission truck;  or 
4) exclusively for monitoring the performance of equipment installed on a vehicle used for safety 
purposes in connection with the operations of a natural gas, water, or electric utility. 
GPS devices are also excluded from this section. 
547.613 – Restriction on Windows 
This is a complicated section that governs both window tint and any other obstruction on the windows 
or windshield.  
Object/Material Obstructs or Reduces Clear View (NOT WINDOW TINT) 
(a)(1) is the offense of placing an object or material on or attached to the windshield or windows that 
obstructs the operator’s clear view.  In order to take enforcement action, the officer must articulate that 
the object obstructed or reduces the operator’s clear view. 
Window Tint/Film 
(a)(2) deals specifically with window tint or other transparent material that alters the color or reduces 
the light transmission.  This subsection essentially says it is illegal to place such material on a vehicle’s 
windshield or windows, however (b) provides numerous exceptions. 
BPOC Student Manual - Page 189 
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
(a-1)  A person who is in the business of installing window tint commits an offense if they do not install 
the label required by 547.609 (stating the tint complies with state standards).  Note that the 
operator/owner does not commit this offense – it is specific to a person “in the business of installing” 
transparent material.  This offense carries a fine up to $1000. 
Exceptions 
(b)  There are numerous exceptions to the regulation of window tint and obstructions this section: 
1) Tint may be installed above the AS1 line on the windshield (or 5” from the top) as long as it has a 
light transmission of 25% or more, and is not red, amber, or blue.  Note: this means tint should 
never be below the AS1 line.  Anything else attached to the windshield (not tint) is not illegal 
unless it obstructs or reduces the operator’s clear view. 
Below AS1 Line – no 
tint allowed 
Above AS1 Line may 
be tinted, but may not 
be red, blue, or amber 
and must have at least 
25% light transmission. 
2) The side windows or wing vent windows of a vehicle to the left or right of the operator may be 
tinted as long as the tint has a light transmission of 25% or more or a luminous reflectance of 
25% or less.   
2-a) The side windows of a vehicle to the rear of the operator can be tinted or obstructed without 
violation regardless of light transmission.   
Side window left or 
right of operator – 
may be tinted, but 
must have 25% light 
transmission 
Side window to the 
rear of the operator 
may be tinted or 
obstructed without 
restrictions

Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
3) The rear window (back windshield/glass) of a vehicle can be tinted or obstructed without 
violation regardless of light transmission as long as the vehicle is equipped with outside mirrors 
on each side of the vehicle. 
4) A rearview mirror should not be considered a violation for obstructing the operator’s view. 
5) An adjustable nontransparent sun visor should not be considered a violation for obstructing the 
operator’s view. 
6) A direction, destination, or termination sign on a passenger carrier should not be considered a 
violation for obstructing the operator’s view as long as the operator can still see approaching 
traffic. 
7) A rear window wiper motor should not be considered a violation for obstructing the operator’s 
view. 
8) A rear trunk lid handle or hinge should not be considered a violation for obstructing the 
operator’s view. 
9) A luggage rack attached to the rear trunk should not be considered a violation for obstructing 
the operator’s view. 
10)  A side window to the rear of the vehicle operator on a multipurpose vehicle (SUV). Note: this 
is old language – all vehicles now have this exception under (2-a) above. 
11) A US or local certificate attached to the window should not be considered a violation for 
obstructing the operator’s view (i.e. a registration insignia). 
12) A motor vehicle not registered in Texas is not subject to this section – this means their 
windows/windshield can be tinted or obstructed without violation. 
13) A window that has received factory coating or tinting in compliance with manufacturer’s 
requirements is not considered to be in violation of this section. 
14) A vehicle that is used regularly to transport passengers for a fee and authorized to operate 
under license or permit by a local authority (buses, taxis, limos, etc.) are not subject to this 
section and can have tinted or obstructed windows.   
15) Law enforcement vehicles are exempt from this section. 
16) Commercial motor vehicles as defined by 644.001 are exempt from this section (these vehicles 
are subject to the federal regulations and window tint is governed for them by the fed regs).    
(d) Tolerance – This section allows for a variance of 3% on the required light transmission of a given 
window.  THP Policy:  Allow 5% before writing a citation (clear cut and substantial violation). 
(e)  Defense to Prosecution – It is a defense to prosecution that the defendant or a passenger in the 
vehicle at the time of the violation is required for a medical reason to be shielded from direct rays of the 
sun.  Officers roadside with a person claiming a medical defense to prosecution for window tint should 
BPOC Student Manual - Page 191 
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
request to see a letter from a medical professional.  As with all defenses to prosecution, officers may still 
issue a citation, however if the defense appears to be legitimate a citation is generally not issued.  See 
reference below for more information about the medical exception in DPS administrative code.  Note 
the medical exception still does not allow the windshield to be tinted: 
Administrative Code Title 37, Part 1, Rule 21.3, subsection 21.3:     
(e)  Medical exceptions. 
(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a motor vehicle operated by or 
regularly used to transport any person with a medical condition which renders the person 
susceptible to harm or injury from exposure to sunlight or bright artificial light may be equipped, on 
all the windows except the windshield, with sunscreening devices that reduces the light 
transmission values of less than 25%. An untinted film or glaze may be applied to the area below 
the AS-1 line of the windshield of a motor vehicle provided the total visible light transmission is 
not reduced by 5%. Vehicles equipped with sunscreening devices under this medical exception shall 
not be operated on any highway unless, while being so operated, the driver or an occupant of the 
vehicle possesses a signed statement from a licensed physician or licensed optometrist. 
(2) The signed statement from a licensed physician or licensed optometrist shall: 
(A) identify with reasonable specificity the driver or occupant of the vehicle; and 
(B) state that, in the physician's or optometrist's professional opinion, the equipping of the vehicle 
with sunscreening devices is necessary to safeguard the health of the driver or occupant of the 
vehicle. 
Window Tint Summary for Vehicles Registered in Texas 
547.615 – Recording Devices 
This section defines recording devices such as airbag control modules, powertrain control modules, or 
OnStar-type crash information recording and describes the circumstances under which law enforcement 
may retrieve the stored information. 
(c)  Information recorded or transmitted by a recording device may not be retrieved by a person other 
than the owner of the motor vehicle in which the recording device is installed except in one of the 
following four circumstances: 
BPOC Student Manual - Page 192 
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
1) With a court order 
2) With the owner’s consent 
3) For the purpose of improving motor vehicle safety if the owner or driver’s identification is not 
disclosed (i.e. vehicle safety researchers studying crash data) 
4) For the purposes of determining the need for emergency medical response in the event of a 
crash (i.e. OnStar or similar on-board assistance). 
DPS Guidance regarding “recording device” downloads: 
547.616 – Radar Interference Devices; Offense 
A person may not use, attempt to use, install, operate, or attempt to operate a radar interference 
device in a motor vehicle operated by the person.  
This is a device that actively jams or disables radar.  Passive devices like radar detectors do not meet the 
definition of radar interference devices and do not constitute a violation of this section. 
547.617 – Motorcycle Footrests and Handholds Required 
This section requires that a motorcycle or moped that is designed to carry more than one person be  
equipped with footrests and handholds for use by the passenger. 
This section does not apply to an autocycle or a fully enclosed “motorcycle” as defined in 521.001(a)(6
a). 
BPOC Student Manual - Page 193 
Texas Highway Patrol - Texas Transportation Code                                                            
547.618 – Equipment Required for Certain Automated Motor Vehicles   
(b)  An automated motor vehicle that is designed to be operated exclusively by the automated driving 
system for all trips is not subject to motor vehicle equipment laws or regulations of this state that:  
1) relate to or support motor vehicle operation by a human driver; and 
2) are not relevant for an automated driving system.  
Example:  Motor vehicles are required to be equipped with at least one mirror.  An automated motor 
vehicle that never has an actual human driver, however, may have no need for a mirror because the 
vehicle is equipped with multiple cameras providing necessary views.  The vehicle is not in violation for 
having no mirror because there is no human driver to use the mirror. 
(c) If a vehicle safety inspection is required for the operation of a vehicle described by Subsection (b), 
the vehicle shall automatically be considered to pass the inspection with respect to any equipment from 
which the vehicle is exempt under Subsection (b). 
Reference 545.451 – Automated motor vehicle definition. 
547.701 – Additional Equipment for School Buses 
(a) Required Equipment for School Buses 
1) convex mirror – to see the area directly in front of the bus 
2) red flashing signal lamps in a prescribed configuration – two to the front, two to the rear, visible 
to a distance of 500 feet.     
(b) Permitted Equipment for School Buses (may be equipped, but not required) 
1) rooftop warning lamps – a white strobing warning lamp. 
2) movable stop arms – deployed in conjunction with the flashing red lights 
(c)  Flashing warning lights and other equipment MUST be used when a school bus is being stopped or is 
stopped on a highway to permit students to board or exit the bus.  
(c-1) Operating bus warning lights outside of loading/unloading children on a highway is prohibited. 
(e)  A bus that is a model year of 2018 or later and operated by or contracted for use by a school district 
for the transportation of schoolchildren shall be equipped with a three-point seat belt for each 
passenger, including the operator.  This requirement does not apply if the board of trustees for the 
school district determines that the district's budget does not permit the district to purchase a bus that is 
equipped with the seat belts required by this subsection and votes to approve that determination in a 
public meeting. 
Note:  Although most new school buses are required to be equipped with safety belts, the bus 
passengers are not required to be buckled by state law (only the operator must be buckled).  This is 
because a school bus does not meet the definition of a “passenger vehicle” utilized in 545.412 and

illuminated.  This does not apply to a motorcycle manufactured before the model year 1975. 
MC Headlamp Modulators – Motorcycles equipped with headlamp modulators that rapidly vary the 
intensity of the headlamp to increase conspicuity are not in violation for displaying a flashing white lamp 
because the headlamp is not turned off and on as it modulates.  These modulators are permitted by the 
Federal 108 Lighting Standard (S10.17.5).
